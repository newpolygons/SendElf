# SendElf
 Send Elf File To PS5


# Usage

Place PS5 ip, host, and filepath into the script then run it. Will likely implement -f -p -i as arguments in the near future.

# 5.50

My machine is currently on 5.50 I was experincing an issue where after sending nothing would happen rebooting PS5 and trying again resolved the issue.
