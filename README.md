# SendElf
 Send Elf File To PS5


# Usage

Place PS5 ip, host, and filepath into the script then run it.

If you are having issues with the socket implementation you can now run python3 sendPS5.py -nc to send the file through netcat.

# 5.50

My machine is currently on 5.50 I was experincing an issue where after sending the file nothing would happen. Rebooting PS5 and trying again resolved the issue.
